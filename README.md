# MY-Portfolio
Starting my data analytics career, I analyze retail sales to uncover trends and optimize strategies, create financial dashboards for better decision-making, examine web traffic to improve user experience and conversions, and analyze customer feedback to enhance products and services. Each project provides actionable business insights.
